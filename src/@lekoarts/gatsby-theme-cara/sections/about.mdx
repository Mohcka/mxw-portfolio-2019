## About

#### I'm a jr web developer who has an affinity for javascript, [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)

I started off learning Java in my highschool's AP Computer Science course.  As I got to college I continued taking courses on other programming languages, data sciences, and machine coding.  During that time I started learning javascript and web development on the side, and the more I learned, the more I became amazed by how expansive and versatile javascript was as a programming language, being used numerous types of applications such as web, mobile, and even desktop apps.

Along the way I've learn methods to make such apps and used powerful technologies such as [React](https://reactjs.org/) for creating reusable components for use on multiple projects, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle and minify assets as well as take advantage of [Babel compilation](https://babeljs.io) and database query languages like [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/).  Recently I've been using the SSG [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (which I also used to create this portfolio) to create fast and secure websites while also implementing a CMS to give users a friendly experience on customizing and adding to their websites.

I currently work as a web programmer coding javascript and developing web components using a CMS to ease and speed up development of websites for me and my coworkers.
