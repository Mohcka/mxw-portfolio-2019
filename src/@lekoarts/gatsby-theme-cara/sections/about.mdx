## About

> I'm a jr web developer who has an affinity for javascript, [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)

I started off learning Java in my highschool's AP Computer Science course.  As I got to college I continued taking courses on other programming languages, data sciences, and machine coding.  During that time I started learning javascript and web development on the side.  

I currently work as a web programmer coding javascript and developing React Based web components using a CMS to ease and speed up development of websites for me and my coworkers.
