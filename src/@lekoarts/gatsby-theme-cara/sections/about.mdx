## About

> I'm a jr web developer who has an affinity for javascript, [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)

I started off learning Java in my highschool's AP Computer Science course.  As I got to college I continued taking courses on other programming languages, data sciences, and machine coding.  During that time I started learning javascript and web development on the side.  

I currently work as a web developer at my company, building websites with a CMS to create user friendly websites for our clients.  I'm also working on creating tools to automate tasks for my coworkers as well as developing a static site generator with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) that will utilize a CMS to replace the one we're currently using.
