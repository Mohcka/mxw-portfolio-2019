  My job goes through a lot of data entry. In a response to that, i use{" "}

  <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electronjs</a> to create a redistributable
  app that allows anyone who uses the app to automate their everyday work tasks

  Not exactly Reddit. Not Exactly a Clone. This was a little project i did to
  see if i could make a webapp that had some similar functionality to reddit
  using React and Express. It's a little bare, but functional.

  I use discord a lot.  So i figured I'd create a bot that plays music so i can show everyone what good taste i have.  This bot used the <a href="https://discord.js.org/#/">discord.js</a> library as well as <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/">YouTube's API</a> to fetch video data and stream audio over voice channels.
